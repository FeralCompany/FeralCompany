## [UNRELEASED]

### Added

- Added Compass to Map
- Added "Pointer" system to Map
  - Will track Fire exits, main entrances, and the ship. Both from inside
    and outside the facility.

### Removed

- Removed SettingsMenu.
  - Ideally, I'll come back to this. I'm just not great at designing things
  and I can't really be bothered to do it, right now. The current assets
  still exist, so nothing of value is lost.
- Removed Locale configuration.
  - The systems are still in place, there just isn't any client-facing
  text that needs to be translated. To avoid confusion, this has been
  removed until that changes.

## Version 0.0.1

# FeralCompany

Play with some advantages.

## Minimap

![FeralCompany Minimap Preview](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/FeralCompany/FeralCompany/main/.github/images/feralcompany-static-minimap-preview.png "FeralCompany Minimap")

A very configurable Minimap, with various features:

- Zooms in and out
- Scales up and down
- Pointers for various locations:
  - Inside the facility: Main and Fire Exits
  - Outside the facility: Main and Fire Entrances, Ship
- Compass
- Very highly detailed (no more texture draws!)
- Does not hijack the main ship's camera
- Configurable backlight for both inside and outside the facility

## Night Vision

Very configurable, non-eye-straining night vision.

- Different intensities configurable for both inside and outside the facility.
- That's pretty much it.

## Default Keybindings

Note, most keybindings can be configured with [InputUtils](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Rune580/LethalCompany_InputUtils/).

| Key                | Purpose           | Configurable |
|--------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| `M`                | Toggle Map        | Yes          |
| `.`                | Cycle Map Targets | Yes          |
| `Alt+Scroll`       | Zoom Map In/Out   | No           |
| `Alt+Shift+Scroll` | Scale Map Up/Down | No           |

## In-Game Configuration

No specific support is provided for [LethalConfig](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AinaVT/LethalConfig/),
however all configurations are updated in real-time when changed via LethalConfig. No restarting necessary.
